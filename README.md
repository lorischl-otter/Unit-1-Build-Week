# Unit 1 Build Week

The goal of our first Lambda School Data Science project was to select a dataset and a research question, and then clean, explore, and visualize the data and articulate findings. My final notebook for the project is located in this repo, and the final article I wrote to explain the data and visualizations can be found [here](https://medium.com/@lori.schlatter/what-correlates-with-an-employee-wanting-to-leave-the-job-cde7249f74a).
